# comfy-cli installs ComfyUI into its own workspace venv (/comfyui/.venv), but
# start.sh launches ComfyUI with /opt/venv's python. That mismatch leaves the
# launch venv missing ComfyUI's runtime deps (e.g. sqlalchemy, pulled in by
# ComfyUI's asset DB), so ComfyUI crashes at startup and surfaces as the
# misleading "ComfyUI server (127.0.0.1:8188) not reachable" error. Mirror
# ComfyUI's full dependency set (core + custom nodes) into /opt/venv so the
# launch venv is complete. Root-cause fix for DR-1170.
#
# The transformers/huggingface-hub pin is part of the SAME step on purpose:
# ComfyUI declares transformers>=4.50.3 and huggingface-hub with NO upper bound,
# so a fresh install can pull transformers 5.x / huggingface-hub 1.x whose
# breaking API changes also crash ComfyUI at startup. Pinning them in the same
# RUN downgrades within one layer, so the unwanted versions aren't left behind
# bloating the image.
